                         Parties almost every weekend and lavish employee birthday celebrations!
                          Unfortunately, covid ruined that fun like it did almost everything else in the world.
                           But we try our best to zhuzh it up a bit. For example, we host biweekly Devtalks where 
                           our senior and lead developers talk about topics they are passionate about. Previous 
                           topics have included Web3, NFT, Laravel 9, Kubernetes, etc. We hold these talks in the 
                           office but you can join our Zoom broadcast as well. Feel free to join either as an attendee
                            or a speaker!</p>
